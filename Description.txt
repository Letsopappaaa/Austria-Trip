Data source: personal Strava GPX file exports

Used GPSBabel to:
	Convert GPX to CSV fileformat
	Simplify GPS data. Some downfiltering of the raw data was necessary to improve performance in Tableau. Route GPS location information simplified from ~60k to ~20k, results in a minimum resolution of 1 datapoint/30 meters, on average.
	Generate estimated speed and distance data.

Minor data processing in Excel, date formatting etc.
The output from GPSBabel was fed into Tableau to generate the visuals.
